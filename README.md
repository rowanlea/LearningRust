# LearningRust
Today I'm having a go at learning Rust for the first time!

I have just a few hours to learn enough Rust to try and help assist with the teaching of it.

The code will most likely end up looking fairly horrifying (especially to any Rust pros out there), but I thought it would be fun to share how I get on.

If you're interested in learning more about Rust from some actual experts feel free to ping me a message at mail@rowanlea.co.uk and I'll pass your questions on!
